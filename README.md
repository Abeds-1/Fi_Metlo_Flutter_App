# Fi_Metlo_Flutter_App
FiMetlo is an intuitive Flutter app that provides cheaper alternatives to big company products. Developed for the Lebanese economic crisis, it simplifies the search for affordable options with its user-friendly interface and powerful search capabilities.

Our application was developed and tested on the Pixel 2 API 30 Android emulator. 
For the best possible experience, we recommend using this emulator when running the application.
